## :godmode: shkm's dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. They're managed using [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

A `stow.sh` script is provided to get up and running.

Platform-specific overrides go in their subjective folder (e.g. `macos` and `linux`) and should somehow be sourced by a master script.

If you think I can improve something, a pull request is appreciated! If you're not sure what something does, feel free to open an issue.
