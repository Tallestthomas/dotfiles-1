# Dotfiles

## Summary

These are my dotfiles. They were created using the [bare git repo method](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/) (though I've opted for ~/.dotfiles over ~/.cfg) in order to sidestep the whole symlink nonsense. 

## Requirements

- git

## Additional thoughts

- Consider writing a snippet to pull these down for the first time, as described in the article above.
- An init script can still be useful, particularly for default OS settings. Perhaps that's something for another repo, though?
